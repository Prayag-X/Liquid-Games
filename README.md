# Liquid Games

Task 2 for Liquid Galaxy GSOC 23 by Prayag Biswas

For the task, I tried to create a similar app to lg-retro-gaming from scratch and using my own approach.
It connects to the lg rig using ssh and sends the required commands for opening and closing any games.
And uses the webview for controlling the games.

## Preferred Display size:

Resolution mode: Portrait
Resolution: 900 x 1600
Pixel density: 320 DPI

## How to use:

1. Install the .apk from ./releases
2. Open the installed app.
3. Goto the settings for any desired changes.
4. Open your LG rig setup.
5. Click on any buttons in the homepage.
6. Enjoy :)
